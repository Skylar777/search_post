There are 3 different logic problems here and one set of tree/graph searches done on a famous graph with Arad being the initial state and Bucharest being the final state (Search.java)
The first logic problem is the Wolf-goat-cabbage problem (Problem6a.java)
-You are on the bank of a river with a boat, a cabbage, a goat, and a wolf. Your task is to get everything to the other side. Restrictions are as follows.
-1. only you can handle the boat
-2. when you're in the boat, there is only space for one more item
-3. you can't leave the goat alone with the wolf, nor with the cabbage (or something will be eaten).
The second logic problem is the Missionaries and cannibals problem (Problem6b.java)
-Three missionaries and three cannibals seek to cross a river, say from the left bank to the right bank. A boat that may be navigated by any combination of one or two people is available on their side of the river. If cannibals outnumber the missionaries on either side of the river at any time, the cannibals will indulge in their anthropophagic tendencies and do away with the missionaries. Find a sequence of boat trips that will permit all the missionaries and cannibals to cross the river safely.
The third logic problem is the Pancake Sorting Problem (Problem6c.java)
-Given a stack of pancakes of various sizes, can you sort them into a stack of decreasing sizes, largest on bottom to smallest on top? You have a spatula with which you can flip the top i pancakes.
